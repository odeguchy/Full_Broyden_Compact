# Full_Broyden_Compact
This repository contains the MATLAB support functions and the main functions to compute the full Broyden compact
representation and its inverse. 
The function B_comp.m computes the full Broyden compact representation update.
The function H_comp.m computes the full Broyden compact representation inverse in order to solve the linear system
Bcomp r = z, for the vector r. 
FBroydenDemo.m computes both of the compact representation given the included data Demo_Data.mat
